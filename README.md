# Byteroot

## About the Product

**Byteroot** is an application inspired by the concept of the vegetable beetroot, where each individual's contributions contribute to the growth of the community. It stands out as a unique platform, promoting community engagement and collaborative activities in problem-solving and algorithm creation. The platform ensures the validity of posted questions through a stringent validation process, offering users a reliable space to code, problem-solve, and access solutions.

## Technologies Used

Our codebase is built on the robust foundation of **Marbilism**. To elevate our code quality and efficiency, we've incorporated cutting-edge technologies such as **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. For backend development and production, we rely on **Node.js** and **Docker**, enabling seamless deployment and scalability. We manage database operations efficiently using **PostgreSQL**. To ensure code accuracy and security, we utilize **PistonAPI** services for compiler checking. Additionally, our question validation process is powered by **OpenAI**. We foster real-time discussions and collaboration through **WebSockets** integration with **Node.js**.

## Target Audience

- Developers and Coders
- Tech Enthusiasts
- Educational Institutions
- Tech Companies
- Freelancers and Gig Workers
- Coding Communities

## Future Components/Scalability

Institutions can use the application for conducting discussions, giving assignments to students, and providing an arena for student group assignments/projects and group discussion centers. We plan to implement topic-based segregation of problems to enhance user experience and facilitate better problem-solving.

## Main Motive

**Byteroots** aims to create a collaborative environment for coders worldwide, where they can share knowledge, solve coding challenges, and engage in discussions, fostering a sense of community and mutual support. By offering a platform for problem-solving, code creation, and discussion, Byteroots encourages innovation and creativity among its users. It serves as a space where new ideas can be explored, tested, and refined, leading to the development of innovative solutions and projects.
